This is a starting point for {{language_name}} solutions to the
["Build Your Own <fill_in_course_name>" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/<fill_in_course_slug>/overview).

_Add a description of your course here_

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your `<fill_in_executable_name>` implementation is in `{{ user_editable_file }}`. Study and uncomment the relevant code, and
push your changes to pass the first stage:

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `{{ required_executable }}` installed locally
1. Run `./<fill_in_script_name>.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `{{ user_editable_file }}`.{{# language_is_rust }} This command compiles your
   Rust project, so it might be slow the first time you run it. Subsequent runs
   will be fast.{{/ language_is_rust}}
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
