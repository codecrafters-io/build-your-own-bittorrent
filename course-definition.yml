        [Bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode) (pronounced *Bee-encode*) is a serialization format used in [the BitTorrent protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html). It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.

        Bencode supports four data types:
        - strings
        - integers
        - arrays
        - dictionaries

        In this stage, we'll focus on decoding strings.

        Strings are encoded as `<length>:<contents>`. For example, the string `"hello"` is encoded as `"5:hello"`.

        You'll implement a `decode` command which takes a bencoded value as input and prints the decoded value as JSON.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh decode 5:hello
        "hello"
        ```

        A torrent file (also known as a [metainfo file](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#metainfo-files)) contains a bencoded dictionary with the following keys and values:

        - `announce`:
            - URL to a "tracker", which is a central server that keeps track of peers participating in the sharing of a torrent.
        - `info`:
            - A dictionary with keys:
                - `length`: size of the file in bytes, for single-file torrents
                - `name`: suggested name to save the file / directory as
                - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece

        Info hash is a unique identifier for a torrent file. It's used when talking to trackers or peers.

        In this stage, you'll calculate the info hash for a torrent file and print it in hexadecimal format.

        To calculate the info hash, you'll need to:

        - Extract the `info` dictionary from the torrent file after parsing
        - Bencode the contents of the `info` dictionary
        - Calculate the SHA-1 hash of this bencoded dictionary

    description_md: |-
        In a torrent, a file is split into equally-sized parts called **pieces**. A piece is usually 256 KB or 1 MB in size.

        Each piece is assigned a SHA-1 hash value. On public networks, there may be malicious peers that send fake data. These hash values allow us to verify the integrity of each piece that we'll download.

        Piece length and piece hashes are specified in the `info` dictionary of the torrent file under the following keys:

        - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece, an integer
        - `pieces`: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece (20 bytes each), a string

        The [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#info-dictionary) has more information about these keys.

        In this stage, the tester will expect your program to print piece length and a list of piece hashes in hexadecimal format.

        Trackers are central servers that maintain information about peers participating in the sharing and downloading of a torrent.

        In this stage, you'll make a GET request to a HTTP tracker to discover peers to download the file from.

        ### Tracker GET request

        You'll need to make a request to the tracker URL you extracted in the previous stage, and include these query params:

        - `info_hash`: the info hash of the torrent
            - 20 bytes long, will need to be URL encoded
            - **Note**: this is **NOT** the hexadecimal representation, which is 40 bytes long
        - `peer_id`: a unique identifier for your client
            - A string of length 20 that you get to pick. You can use something like `00112233445566778899`.
        - `port`: the port your client is listening on
            - You can set this to `6881`, you will not have to support this functionality during this challenge.
        - `uploaded`: the total amount uploaded so far
            - Since your client hasn't uploaded anything yet, you can set this to `0`.
        - `downloaded`: the total amount downloaded so far
            - Since your client hasn't downloaded anything yet, you can set this to `0`.
        - `left`: the number of bytes left to download
            - Since you client hasn't downloaded anything yet, this'll be the total length of the file (you've extracted this value from the torrent file in previous stages)
        - `compact`: whether the peer list should use the [compact representation](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0023.html)
            - For the purposes of this challenge, set this to `1`.
            - The compact representation is more commonly used in the wild, the non-compact representation is mostly supported for backward-compatibility.

        Read [the BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#trackers) for more information about these query parameters.

        ### Tracker response

        The tracker's response will be a bencoded dictionary with two keys:

        - `interval`:
            - An integer, indicating how often your client should make a request to the tracker.
            - You can ignore this value for the purposes of this challenge.
        - `peers`.
            - A string, which contains list of peers that your client can connect to.
            - Each peer is represented using 6 bytes. The first 4 bytes are the peer's IP address and the last 2 bytes are the peer's port number.

        In this stage, you’ll establish a TCP connection with a peer and complete a handshake.

        The handshake is a message consisting of the following parts as described in the [peer protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-protocol):

        1. length of the protocol string (BitTorrent protocol) which is `19` (1 byte)
        2. the string `BitTorrent protocol` (19 bytes)
        3. eight reserved bytes, which are all set to zero (8 bytes)
        4. sha1 infohash (20 bytes) (**NOT** the hexadecimal representation, which is 40 bytes long)
        5. peer id (20 bytes) (you can use `00112233445566778899` for this challenge)

        After we send a handshake to our peer, we should receive a handshake back in the same format.

        Your program should print the hexadecimal representation of the peer id you've received during the handshake.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh handshake sample.torrent <peer_ip>:<peer_port>

        In this stage, you'll download one piece and save it to disk. In the next stage we'll combine these pieces into a file.

        To download a piece, your program will need to need to send [peer messages](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-messages) to a peer. The overall flow looks like this:

        - Read the torrent file to get the tracker URL
            - you've done this in previous stages
        - Perform the tracker GET request to get a list of peers
            - you've done this in previous stages
        - Establish a TCP connection with a peer, and perform a handshake
            - you've done this in previous stages
        - Exchange multiple [peer messages](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-messages) to download the file
            - **This is the part you'll implement in this stage**

        Peer messages consist of a message length prefix (4 bytes), message id (1 byte) and a payload (variable size).

        Here are the peer messages you'll need to exchange once the handshake is complete:

        - Wait for a `bitfield` message from the peer indicating which pieces it has
            - The message id for this message type is `5`.
            - You can read and ignore the payload for now, the tracker we use for this challenge ensures that all peers have all pieces available.
        - Send an `interested` message
            - The message id for `interested` is `2`.
            - The payload for this message is empty.
        - Wait until you receive an `unchoke` message back
            - The message id for `unchoke` is `1`.
            - The payload for this message is empty.
        - Break the piece into blocks of 16 kiB (16 * 1024 bytes) and send a `request` message for each block
            - The message id for `request` is `6`.
            - The payload for this message consists of:
                - `index`: the zero-based piece index
                - `begin`: the zero-based byte offset within the piece
                    - This'll be `0` for the first block, `2^14` for the second block, 2*2^14 for the third block etc.
                - `length`: the length of the block in bytes
                    - This'll be `2^14` (16 * 1024) for all blocks except the last one.
                    - The last block will contain `2^14` bytes or less, you'll need calculate this value using the piece length.
        - Wait for a `piece` message for each block you've requested
            - The message id for `piece` is `7`.
            - The payload for this message consists of:
                - `index`: the zero-based piece index
                - `begin`: the zero-based byte offset within the piece
                - `block`: the data for the piece, usually `2^14` bytes long

        After receiving blocks and combining them into pieces, you'll want to check the integrity of each piece by comparing it's hash
        with the piece hash value found in the torrent file.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh download_piece -o /tmp/test-piece-0 sample.torrent 0
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        Piece 0 downloaded to /tmp/test-piece-0.
        ```

        **Optional:** To improve download speeds, you can consider pipelining your requests. [BitTorrent Economics Paper](http://bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf) recommends having 5 requests pending at once, to avoid a delay between blocks being sent.

        In this stage, you'll connect to a peer and download a piece of the file. You'll download the piece in blocks, which you'll later combine and verify using SHA-1, a cryptographic hash value.

        In this stage, you’ll download the entire file and save it to disk.

        You can start with using a single peer to download all the pieces. You’ll need to download all the pieces, verify their integrity using piece hashes, and combine them to assemble the file.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh download -o /tmp/test.txt sample.torrent
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        Downloaded test.torrent to /tmp/test.txt.
        ```

        **Optional:** To improve download speeds, you can download from multiple peers at once. You could have a work queue consisting of each piece that needs to be downloaded. Your worker (connection with a peer) could pick a piece from the work queue, attempt to download it, check the integrity, and write the downloaded piece into a buffer. Any failure (network issue, hashes not matching, peer not having the piece etc.) would put the piece back into the work queue to be tried again.
