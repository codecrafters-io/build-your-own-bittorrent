      [Bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode) (pronounced *Bee-encode*) is a serialization format used in [the BitTorrent protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html). It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.

      Bencode supports four data types:
      - strings
      - integers
      - arrays
      - dictionaries

      In this stage, we'll focus on decoding strings.

      Strings are encoded as `<length>:<contents>`. For example, the string `"hello"` is encoded as `"5:hello"`.

      You'll implement a `decode` command which takes a bencoded value as input and prints the decoded value as JSON.

      Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

      ```
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh decode 5:hello
      "hello"
      ```

      A torrent file (also known as a [metainfo file](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#metainfo-files)) contains a bencoded dictionary with the following keys and values:

      - `announce`:

              - `length`: size of the file in bytes, for single-file torrents
              - `name`: suggested name to save the file / directory as
              - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece

    description_md: |-
      In a torrent, a file is split into equally-sized parts called **pieces**. A piece is usually 256 KB or 1 MB in size.

      Each piece is assigned a SHA-1 hash value. On public networks, there may be malicious peers that send fake data. These hash values allow us to verify the integrity of each piece that we'll download.

      Piece length and piece hashes are specified in the `info` dictionary of the torrent file under the following keys:

      - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece, an integer
      - `pieces`: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece (20 bytes each), a string

      The [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#info-dictionary) has more information about these keys.

      Trackers are central servers that maintain information about peers participating in the sharing and downloading of a torrent.

      In this stage, you'll make a GET request to a HTTP tracker to discover peers to download the file from.

      ### Tracker GET request

      You'll need to make a request to the tracker URL you extracted in the previous stage, and include these query params:

      - `info_hash`: the info hash of the torrent
          - 20 bytes long, will need to be URL encoded
          - **Note**: this is **NOT** the hexadecimal representation, which is 40 bytes long
      - `peer_id`: a unique identifier for your client
          - A string of length 20 that you get to pick. You can use something like `00112233445566778899`.
      - `port`: the port your client is listening on
          - You can set this to `6881`, you will not have to support this functionality during this challenge.
      - `uploaded`: the total amount uploaded so far
          - Since your client hasn't uploaded anything yet, you can set this to `0`.
      - `downloaded`: the total amount downloaded so far
          - Since your client hasn't downloaded anything yet, you can set this to `0`.
      - `left`: the number of bytes left to download
          - Since you client hasn't downloaded anything yet, this'll be the total length of the file (you've extracted this value from the torrent file in previous stages)
      - `compact`: whether the peer list should use the [compact representation](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0023.html)
          - For the purposes of this challenge, set this to `1`.
          - The compact representation is more commonly used in the wild, the non-compact representation is mostly supported for backward-compatibility.

      Read [the BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#trackers) for more information about these query parameters.

      ### Tracker response

      The tracker's response will be a bencoded dictionary with two keys:

      - `interval`:
          - An integer, indicating how often your client should make a request to the tracker.
          - You can ignore this value for the purposes of this challenge.
      - `peers`.
          - A string, which contains list of peers that your client can connect to.
          - Each peer is represented using 6 bytes. The first 4 bytes are the peer's IP address and the last 2 bytes are the peer's port number.

      In this stage, you’ll establish a TCP connection with a peer and complete a handshake.

      The handshake is a message consisting of the following parts as described in the [peer protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-protocol):

      1. length of the protocol string (BitTorrent protocol) which is `19` (1 byte)
      2. the string `BitTorrent protocol` (19 bytes)
      3. eight reserved bytes, which are all set to zero (8 bytes)
      4. sha1 infohash (20 bytes) (**NOT** the hexadecimal representation, which is 40 bytes long)
      5. peer id (20 bytes) (you can use `00112233445566778899` for this challenge)

      After we send a handshake to our peer, we should receive a handshake back in the same format.

      Your program should print the hexadecimal representation of the peer id you've received during the handshake.

      Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

          - **This is the part you'll implement in this stage**

      ### Peer Messages

      Peer messages consist of a message length prefix (4 bytes), message id (1 byte) and a payload (variable size).

      Here are the peer messages you'll need to exchange once the handshake is complete:

      - Wait for a `bitfield` message from the peer indicating which pieces it has
          - The message id for this message type is `5`.
          - You can read and ignore the payload for now, the tracker we use for this challenge ensures that all peers have all pieces available.
      - Send an `interested` message
          - The message id for `interested` is `2`.
          - The payload for this message is empty.
      - Wait until you receive an `unchoke` message back
          - The message id for `unchoke` is `1`.
          - The payload for this message is empty.
      - Break the piece into blocks of 16 kiB (16 * 1024 bytes) and send a `request` message for each block
          - The message id for `request` is `6`.
          - The payload for this message consists of:
              - `index`: the zero-based piece index
              - `begin`: the zero-based byte offset within the piece
                  - This'll be `0` for the first block, `2^14` for the second block, 2*2^14 for the third block etc.
              - `length`: the length of the block in bytes
                  - This'll be `2^14` (16 * 1024) for all blocks except the last one.
                  - The last block will contain `2^14` bytes or less, you'll need calculate this value using the piece length.
      - Wait for a `piece` message for each block you've requested
          - The message id for `piece` is `7`.
          - The payload for this message consists of:
              - `index`: the zero-based piece index
              - `begin`: the zero-based byte offset within the piece
              - `block`: the data for the piece, usually `2^14` bytes long

      After receiving blocks and combining them into pieces, you'll want to check the integrity of each piece by comparing it's hash
      with the piece hash value found in the torrent file.

      Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
      ```
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh download_piece -o /tmp/test-piece-0 sample.torrent 0
      ```
      and here’s the output it expects:
      ```
      Piece 0 downloaded to /tmp/test-piece-0.
      ```

      **Optional:** To improve download speeds, you can consider pipelining your requests. [BitTorrent Economics Paper](http://bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf) recommends having 5 requests pending at once, to avoid a delay between blocks being sent.

      In this stage, you'll connect to a peer and download a piece of the file. You'll download the piece in blocks, which you'll later combine and verify using SHA-1, a cryptographic hash value.

      In this stage, you’ll download the entire file and save it to disk.

      You can start with using a single peer to download all the pieces. You’ll need to download all the pieces, verify their integrity using piece hashes, and combine them to assemble the file.

      Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
      ```
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh download -o /tmp/test.txt sample.torrent
      ```
      and here’s the output it expects:
      ```
      Downloaded sample.torrent to /tmp/test.txt.
      ```

      **Optional:** To improve download speeds, you can download from multiple peers at once. You could have a work queue consisting of each piece that needs to be downloaded. Your worker (connection with a peer) could pick a piece from the work queue, attempt to download it, check the integrity, and write the downloaded piece into a buffer. Any failure (network issue, hashes not matching, peer not having the piece etc.) would put the piece back into the work queue to be tried again.

      Welcome to the BitTorrent Magnet Links extension! In this extension, you'll add support for downloading files using magnet links.

      In this stage, you will parse a magnet link and print out the info hash and tracker URL.

      ### Magnet links

      [Magnet links](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html) allow users to download files from peers without needing a torrent file.

      For example, here's **sample.torrent** represented as a magnet link:
      `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:d69f91e6b2ae4c542468d1073a71d4ea13879a7f&dn=sample.torrent&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fbittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io%2Fannounce`

      Unlike .torrent files, magnet links don't contain information like file length, piece length and piece hashes. They only include the bare minimum
      information necessary to discover peers. A client can then request the rest of the information from peers using the [metadata exchange protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html#metadata-exchange).

      These are the query parameters in a magnet link:

      - `xt`: `urn:btih:` followed by the 40-char hex-encoded info hash (example: `d69f91e6b2ae4c542468d1073a71d4ea13879a7f`)
      - `dn`: The name of the file to be downloaded (example: `sample.torrent`)
      - `tr`: The tracker URL (example: `http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce`)

      [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) has more information about the magnet link format.

      ### Magnet link example

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh magnet_parse <magnet-link>
      ```

      and here's the output it expects:

      ```bash
      Tracker URL: http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce
      Info Hash: d69f91e6b2ae4c542468d1073a71d4ea13879a7f
      ```

      ### Notes

      - We'll be using v1 of [magnet URI format](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html#magnet-uri-format).
      - `xt` is the only required parameter, all others are optional.
      - A magnet link can contain multiple tracker URLs, but for the purposes of this challenge it'll only contain one.

      In this stage, you'll modify the handshake message to indicate that your client supports extensions.

      ### Extension handshake

      Exchanging torrent metadata between peers wasn't originally part of the standard BitTorrent protocol, it was introduced as
      an [extension](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html).

      This extension uses BitTorrent's [extension protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html) that is designed to add
      functionality without breaking backward-compatibility.

      During the "Peer handshake" stage, the handshake message includes eight reserved bytes (64 bits), all set to zero. To signal
      support for extensions, a client must set the 20th bit from the right (counting starts at 0) in the reserved bytes to 1.

      ### Tests

      In this stage, you'll parse the magnet link and discover peers by connecting to the tracker. You'll establish a TCP connection with
      the first peer and complete a handshake. Your handshake message must indicate extension support by setting the correct reserved bit.

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:

      ```
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh magnet_handshake <magnet-link>
      ```

      and here's the output it expects:

      ```
      Peer ID: 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f1011121314
      ```

      Tester will also assert that correct bit is set in the reserved bytes of the handshake message.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll announce to other clients that you support extensions.

    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for receiving a list of extensions that a peer supports.

      ### Extension handshake

      After the handshake and bitfield messages, clients that support extensions exchange an additional message called the
      [extension handshake](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html#handshake-message). This message includes a dictionary that maps extension names to IDs.

      Extension messages follow the standard BitTorrent message format:

      - message length prefix (4 bytes)
      - message id (1 byte)
        - This will be 20 for all messages implemented by extensions
      - payload (variable size)

      The payload will be structured as follows:

      - extension message id (1 byte)
        - This will be 0 for the extension handshake
      - bencoded dictionary (variable size)
        - This will contain a key "m" with another dictionary as its value.
        - The inner dictionary maps supported extension names to their corresponding message IDs.
        - For example, the inner dictionary contents might be `{"ut_metadata": 1, "ut_pex": 2}`, indicating that the peer supports the "ut_metadata" and "ut_pex" extensions with IDs 1 and 2 respectively.

      The extension name we're interested in is "ut_metadata", which corresponds to the [metadata extension](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html#ut_metadata).

      ### Tests

      In this stage, you'll print out the message ID your peer uses for the metadata extension (the value of "ut_metadata" key in the inner dictionary)

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh magnet_handshake <magnet-link>
      ```

      and here's the output it expects:

      ```
      Peer ID: 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f1011121314
      Peer Metadata Extension ID: 123
      ```

      ### Notes

      - The value of `Peer Metadata Extension ID` will be randomly generated, you'll need to fetch it from the dictionary in the handshake message.
      - Extension IDs need to be stored for every peer, as different peers may use different IDs for the same extension.
      - Client ignore any unrecognized extension names.
      - To avoid collisions, extension names are prefixed with two characters identifying the client that introduced the extension (e.g., "**lt**" for libtorrent or "**ut**" for μTorrent)

      In this stage, you'll send back a list of extensions that your client supports.

      After receiving supported extensions from your peer, you'll send back a peer message with the standard format:
      - message length prefix (4 bytes)
      - message id (1 byte)
      - payload (variable size)

      Message ID will be 20

      The payload will follow this format:
      - extension message id (1 byte)
      - bencoded dictionary (variable size)

      Extension message ID will be 0 for handshake.\
      Your dictionary should at least contain the following keys:
      `{"m": {"ut_metadata": <PICK YOUR ID>}}`
      This dictionary needs to be bencoded.

      You can also include other fields defined in [handshake section](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html#handshake-message) of extension protocol.

      Here's how the tester will execute your program:
      ```
      $ ./your_bittorrent.sh magnet_handshake <magnet-link>
      ```
      and here's the output it expects:
      ```

      Peer Metadata Extension ID: 1
      ```
      (Output same as last stage, tester will assert that correct message is received)

      ### Notes
      - The only requirement on these IDs is that no extension messages share the same one.
      - Setting an ID to zero means that the extension is not supported/disabled.

      Since we're missing details usually found in a .torrent file, such as file length, piece length and piece hashes, we'll send a peer [metadata request](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html#request) message to get these details.

      It will follow the standard message format:
      - message length prefix (4 bytes)
      - message id (1 byte)
      - payload (variable size)

      Message ID will be 20

      The payload will be structured as follows:
      - extension message id (1 byte)
      - bencoded dictionary (variable size)

      Extension message id: You'll use the peer metadata extension ID you received during handshake.\
      Bencoded dictionary: The dictionary that you send will look like this: `{'msg_type': 0, 'piece': 0}`\. It needs to be bencoded.
