        [Bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode) (pronounced *Bee-encode*) is a serialization format used in [the BitTorrent protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html). It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.

        Bencode supports four data types:
        - strings
        - integers
        - arrays
        - dictionaries

        In this stage, we'll focus on decoding strings.

        Strings are encoded as `<length>:<contents>`. For example, the string `"hello"` is encoded as `"5:hello"`.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh decode 5:hello
        "hello"
        ```

    description_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll decode a bencoded integer value.

        Integers are encoded as `i<number>e`. For example, `52` is encoded as `i52e` and `-52` is encoded as `i-52e`.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh decode i52e
        52

        Lists are encoded as `l<bencoded_elements>e`.

        For example, `["hello", 52]` would be encoded as `l5:helloi52ee`. Note that there are no separators between the elements.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

        For example, `{"hello": 52, "foo":"bar"}` would be encoded as: `d3:foo3:bar5:helloi52ee` (note that the keys were reordered).

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

    name: "Parse torrent file"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |
        In this stage, you'll parse a torrent file and print information about the torrent.

        A torrent file (also known as a [metainfo file](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#metainfo-files)) contains a bencoded dictionary with the following values:

        - `announce`:
            - URL to a "tracker", which is a central server that keeps track of peers participating in the sharing of a torrent.
        - `info`:
            - A dictionary with keys:
                - `length`: size of the file in bytes, for single-file torrents
                - `name`: suggested name to save the file / directory as
                - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece
                - `pieces`: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece

        **Note**: The `info` dictionary looks slightly different for multi-file torrents. For this challenge, we'll only implement support for single-file torrents.

        In this stage, we'll focus on extracting the tracker URL and the length of the file (in bytes).

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:

        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh info sample.torrent
        ```

        and here’s the output it expects:

        ```
        Tracker URL: http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce
        Length: 1048500
        ```

    description_md: |
        Info hash is a unique identifier for a torrent file. It's used when talking to trackers or peers.

        In this stage, you'll calculate the info hash for a torrent file and print it in hexadecimal format.

        To calculate the info hash, you'll need to:

        - Extract the `info` dictionary from the torrent file
        - Bencode the contents of the `info` dictionary, and calculate the SHA-1 hash

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh info sample.torrent
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        Tracker URL: http://bittorrent-test-tracker.codecrafters.io/announce

        In this stage, you'll calculate a unique identifier for a torrent, known as info hash, used in communication with trackers and peers.

  - slug: "peers"
    name: "Discover peers"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
        Trackers are central servers that maintain information about peers participating in the sharing and downloading of a torrent.

        In this stage, you'll make a GET request to a HTTP tracker to discover peers to download the file from.

        ### Tracker GET request

        You'll need to make a request to the tracker URL you extracted in the previous stage, and include these query params:

        - `info_hash`: the info hash of the torrent
            - 20 bytes long, will need to be URL encoded
            - **Note**: this is **NOT** the hexadecimal representation, which is 40 bytes long
        - `peer_id`: a unique identifier for your client
            - For the purposes of this challenge, it doesn't matter what you set this to.
            - You can use `00112233445566778899`.
        - `port`: the port your client is listening on
            - For the purposes of this challenge, it doesn't matter what you set this to.
            - You can use `6881`.
        - `uploaded`: the total amount uploaded so far
            - Since your client hasn't uploaded anything yet, you can set this to `0`.
        - `downloaded`: the total amount downloaded so far
            - Since your client hasn't downloaded anything yet, you can set this to `0`.
        - `left`: the number of bytes left to download
            - Since you client hasn't downloaded anything yet, this'll be the total length of the file (you've extracted this value from the torrent file in previous stages)
        - `compact`: whether the peer list should use the [compact representation](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0023.html)
            - For the purposes of this challenge, set this to `1`.
            - The compact representation is more commonly used in the wild, the non-compact representation is mostly supported for backward-compatibility.

        Read [the BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#trackers) for more information about these query parameters.

        ### Tracker response

        The tracker's response will be a bencoded dictionary with two keys:

        - `interval`:
            - An integer, indicating how often your client should make a request to the tracker.
            - You can ignore this value for the purposes of this challenge.
        - `peers`.
            - A string, which contains list of peers that your client can connect to.
            - Each peer is represented using 6 bytes. The first 4 bytes are the peer's IP address and the last 2 bytes are the peer's port number.

        ---

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh peers sample.torrent
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        188.119.61.177:6881
        71.224.0.29:51414
        62.153.208.98:3652
        ```
    marketing_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll interact with a tracker, a central server that keeps track of peers participating in the sharing of a torrent. You'll make a GET request to a HTTP tracker to discover peers from whom you can download the file.

  - slug: "handshake"
    name: "Peer handshake"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll establish a TCP connection with a peer and complete a handshake.

        The handshake is a message consisting of the following parts as described in the [peer protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-protocol):

        1. length of the protocol string (BitTorrent protocol) which is `19`
        2. the string `BitTorrent protocol`
        3. eight reserved bytes, which are all set to zero
        4. 20 byte sha1 infohash
        5. 20 byte peer id (you can use `00112233445566778899` for this challenge)

        After we send a handshake to our peer, we should receive a handshake back in the same format.

        Your program should print the hexadecimal representation of the peer id you've received during the handshake.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh handshake sample.torrent <peer_ip>:<peer_port>
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        Peer ID: 0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f1011121314
        ```

        **Note**: To get a peer IP & port to test this locally, run `./your_bittorrent.sh peers sample.torrent` and pick any peer from the list.
    marketing_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll establish a TCP connection with a peer and complete a handshake according to [BitTorrent Peer Protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-protocol)

  - slug: "hashes"
    name: "Piece hashes"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |
        In a torrent, a file is split into equally-sized parts called **pieces**. A piece is usually 256 KB or 1 MB in size.

        Each piece is assigned a SHA-1 hash value. On public networks, there may be malicious peers that send fake data. These hash values allow us to verify the integrity of each piece that we’ll download.

        The [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#info-dictionary) has more information about the `piece length` and `pieces` keys.

        In this stage, the tester will expect your program to print piece length and a list of piece hashes in hexadecimal format.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh info sample.torrent
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```

        ```
    marketing_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll extract hash values for each piece of the file. On public networks, there may be malicious peers sending fake data. Piece hashes will help us ensure the integrity of downloaded pieces.

  - slug: "dl-piece"
    name: "Download a piece"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll download one piece of the file and save it to disk.

        To download a piece of the file from a peer, first you’ll need to establish a TCP connection and complete a handshake with the peer. After that, you’ll be sending and receiving [peer messages](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-messages). Peer messages consist of a message length prefix (4 bytes), message id (1 byte) and a payload (variable size).

        You’ll first receive a `bitfield` message indicating which pieces your peer has. Peers will have all the pieces downloaded during this challenge so you can read and ignore this message for now.

        You’ll send an `interest` message and wait until you receive an `unchoke` message back from your peer. Once you receive an `unchoke` message, you can start sending `request` messages as described in [peer messages](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-messages). To learn more about choking, a mechanism used to control the number of simultaneous downloads, please refer to the [peer protocol](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#peer-protocol).

        To request a piece, you’ll need to break it down into parts called __blocks__. The default recommended block size is 16 kb. So to download a piece that is 128 kb in size, you would need to make 8 requests because our block size is 16 kb.

        Once you receive all the blocks and combine them, you’ll want to check the integrity of the piece. You can compare the piece hash specified in the torrent file with the hash value you calculate for the bytes you’ve downloaded.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh download_piece -o /tmp/test-piece-0 sample.torrent 0
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        Piece 0 downloaded to /tmp/test-piece-0.
        ```

        **Optional:** To improve download speeds, you can consider pipelining your requests. [BitTorrent Economics Paper](http://bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf) recommends having 5 recommends pending at once, to avoid a delay between blocks being sent. For example, after requesting the first block, instead of waiting for the block to arrive before requesting the next block, try making 5 requests for blocks at once and every time a block arrives, a new request can be sent.
    marketing_md: |
        In this stage, you'll connect to a peer and download a piece of the file. You'll download the piece in blocks, which you'll later combine and verify using SHA-1, a cryptographic hash value.

  - slug: "dl-file"
    name: "Download the whole file"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |
        In this stage, you’ll download the entire file and save it to disk.

        You can start with using a single peer to download all the pieces. You’ll need to download all the pieces, verify their integrity using piece hashes, and combine them to assemble the file.

        Here’s how the tester will execute your program:
        ```
        $ ./your_bittorrent.sh download -o /tmp/test.txt sample.torrent
        ```
        and here’s the output it expects:
        ```
        Downloaded test.torrent to /tmp/test.txt.
        ```

        **Optional:** To improve download speeds, you can download from multiple peers at once. You could have a work queue consisting of each piece that needs to be downloaded. Your worker (connection with a peer) could pick a piece from the work queue, attempt to download it, check the integrity, and write the downloaded piece into a buffer. Any failure (network issue, hashes not matching, peer not having the piece etc.) would put the piece back into the work queue to be tried again.

        In this stage, you'll download the entire file. You'll download all the pieces, verify them using SHA-1 and save them to disk.
